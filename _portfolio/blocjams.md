## Explanation
In this project, I used AngularJS to build a Spotify like application which allows users to listen to a variety of music.

## Problem
I needed to learn how to use AngularJS and its extensive library to build a build a responsive music app.

## Solution
I learned how to control the flow of data in my application and keep the code modularized by using controllers. I learned how to use AngularJS Services to organize and share code across the application especially in regards to the Bloc Jams player bar. I used Angular directives to update the seek bar as a song plays and added an AngularJS filter to convert the song time into minutes.

## Results
My work resulted in a well polished responsive music application in which users could listen to their favorite music.

## Conclusion
I learned that using the AngularJS framework is a great way to extend your HTML vocabulary for your app, it helps you to write cleaner code using less code, and lets you add some control over your app by the way of data binding and controllers.
