## Explanation
In this project I used AngularJS to build a Spotify like application.

## Problem
I needed to learn how to use AngularJS and it's different methods to build the application.

## Solution
I learned how to control the flow of data in my application and keep the code modularized by using controllers. I learned how to use AngularJS Services to organize and share code across the application especially in regards to the Bloc Jams player bar. I used Angular directives to update the seek bar as a song plays and added an AngularJS filter to convert the song time into minutes.

## Results
My work resulted in a well polished responsive music application.

## Conclusion
I learned that AngularJS is a powerful tool that can add a lot of functionality to a website or web application.
