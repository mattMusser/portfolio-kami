## Explanation
In this project I used AngularJs, Firebase and UI Bootstrap to build a chat application that sends and receives messages in real time.

## Problem
I needed to learn how to use Firebase to create rooms in the database and add messages to those rooms and use UI Bootstrap to build modals for creating usernames and chat rooms. I also needed to learn Bootstrap to add a polished design to my app.
