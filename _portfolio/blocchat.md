## Explanation
In this project I used AngularJs, Firebase and Bootstrap to build a chat application that sends and receives messages in real time.

## Problem
I needed to learn how to use Firebase to create rooms in the database and add messages to those rooms and use UI Bootstrap to build modals for creating usernames and chat rooms. I also needed to learn Bootstrap to add a polished design to my app.

## Solution
I used bootstap to add a polished look to my application and used it's grid system to separate the list of room, messages, and message input field into different columns of the page. I used AngularJs and Firebase methods to add rooms and messages to my Firebase database and show those on my page in realtime.

## Results
My work resulted in a polished real-time chat application that is reponsive and user friendly.

## Conclusion
I learned that bootstrap is a powerful tool to give your website or web application more polish and responsiveness. Firebase is powerful tool which adds great database functionality to websites and web applications.
