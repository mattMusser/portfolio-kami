## Explanation
I was assigned to create an app using angular, bootstrap, and firebase that would allow users to create their own usernames, chatrooms, and send messages to each other in those rooms.

## Problem
There aren't many chatroom services left over from the 90's.

## Solution
Bloc Chat lets users create their own user names, create chat rooms, and send messages to other users within those chatrooms.

## Results
A simple app that allows users to chat with each other.

## Conclusion
Bloc Chat is a simple app that anyone can use.
