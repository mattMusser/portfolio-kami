## Explanation
In this project, I used AngularJS, Firebase, and Bootstrap to build a chat application that sends and receives messages in real time.

## Problem
I needed to learn how to use Firebase because I needed a way to facilitate real-time communication to my JavaScript app without adding on my own server. I also need to learn UI Bootstrap so I could build modals that would give users the ability to create user names and their own chat rooms.

## Solution
I used Bootstrap to add a polished look to my application and used its grid system to separate the list of rooms, messages, and message input field into different columns of the page. I used AngularJS and Firebase methods to add rooms and messages to my Firebase database and show those on my page in real-time.

## Results
My work resulted in a polished real-time chat application that is responsive and user-friendly.

## Conclusion
I learned that Bootstrap is a powerful tool to give your website or web application more polish and responsiveness. Firebase is a powerful tool which adds great database capabilities to websites and web applications through their API without needing to add your own back-end server.
