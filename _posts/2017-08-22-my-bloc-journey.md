title: My Bloc Journey So Far/One of My Biggest Challenges
---
My journey with Bloc has been stressful, frustrating, and difficult at times but with that being said I love it! I'm really enjoying Bloc and learning web development. It has been stressful because I've fallen behind but that's mostly because I should have chosen their part-time track starting out and I should have taken academic leave from my job sooner than I did but I have no doubt that I'll finish on time though. Bloc has provided me with, in my opinion, the best mentor in their employment but I almost changed my mind when asked for revisions for my blog posts.

I have found my journey frustrating because the beginning portion of Bloc's web development course covers Front-End development. As I've mentioned before I have discovered that front-end development hasn't been my cup of tea because I'm not able to visualize what the code does graphically and probably because I'm not tapping into the creative side of my brain.

## One of My Biggest Challenges Learning to Develop
One of my biggest challenges while learning to develop has been learning to problem solve which would also have to include, debugging because debugging and problem-solving go hand in hand.

The aspects of debugging that have been challenging have been knowing what to debug and when to debug. One of the biggest ways I've worked at improving my debugging skill has been placing console logs, with their own descriptions, through out my code for different variables and scripts to figure what is throwing the error and doing something I don't expect.
