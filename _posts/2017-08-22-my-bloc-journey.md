title: My Bloc Journey So Far
---
My journey with Bloc has been stressful, frustrating, and difficult at times but with that being said I love it! I'm really enjoying Bloc and learning web development. It has been stressful because I've fallen behind but that's mostly because I should have chosen their part-time track starting out and I should have taken academic leave from my job sooner than I did but I have no doubt that I'll finish on time though. Bloc has provided me with, in my opinion, the best mentor in their employment but I almost changed my mind when asked for revisions for my blog posts. 

I have found my journey frustrating because the beginning portion of Bloc's web development course covers Front-End development. As I've mentioned before I have discovered that front-end development hasn't been my cup of tea because I'm not able to visualise what the code does graphically and probably because I'm not tapping into the creative side of my brain.
