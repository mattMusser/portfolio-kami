title: My Bloc Journey So Far
---
My journey with bloc has been stressful, frustrating, and difficult at times but with that being said I love it! I'm really enjoying Bloc and learning web development. It has been stressful because I've fallen behind but that's mostly because I should have chosen their part-time track starting out and I should have taken academic leave from my job soon than I did but I have no doubt that I'll finish on time though. Bloc has provided me with, in my opinion, the best mentor in their employment. He has a lot of coding experience and is very knowledgeable.
