title: My Goals as a Bloc Student
---
My main over arching goal as a bloc student is to learn full stack web development so I can become a great web developer and get a full-time job as a web developer and some day start my own web development business. That may be my main overarching goals but my under lying goals are mastering debugging, mastering the front-end, mastering the backend, and mastering problem-solving.

## Mastering Debugging
I’ve discovered that using console.log() is a very useful tool when it comes to developing especially when you encounter a problem in your code and have to debug. I’m still learning how to debug but console.log() is a great line of code because you can use it to log code to the console and find where the bug is because sometimes your code doesn’t do what you think it is doing and console logging pieces of your code helps you discover those aspects of your code.

## Mastering the Frontend
The frontend modules of this course haven’t been my favorite so far but I really want to master the frontend skills before my journey at bloc ends.

## Mastering the Backend


## Mastering Problem Solving
Problem-solving is something I really want to get better at and end up mastering because being able to problem solve is an invaluable tool to have as a developer.
